This is a mini project that I did to stop myself from sleeping in past 3:00PM everyday.

It's literally just a bot that spams me with phone calls telling me to wake up. It's hosted
on a raspberry pi which I have to ssh into in order to turn it off, forcing me to wake up.

I have a page on my personal website to set the time that it should wake me up at.
